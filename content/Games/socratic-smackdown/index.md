# Socratic Smackdown
Socratic Smackdown is a 2.5D platform fighter where you play as animalized versions of classic philosophers as they fight for a thought in a king-of-the-hill style game mode.

Do cool combos, use special philosophy-inspired moves, and send opponents flying off the stage in a fun-for-all fighting game experience!
